# Deployment
**Contact:** Please reach out to Jackson Romero (<jtromero@cmu.edu> or <jacksontromero@gmail.com>) for help with deployment or development on q'

## Set-by-step instructions for deploying q' onto a new system (tested on Ubuntu 22.04)

### Postgres
  1. Install postgresql, `sudo apt install postgresql`
2. Switch to postgres user, `sudo -i -u postgres`
3. Create a new user, `createuser --interactive` (I called mine `ohq` and will continue to use that as an example)
4. Create a database with the same name, `createdb ohq`
5. Logout of the postgres user, `^D`
6. Add new Linux user with the same name, `sudo adduser ohq`
7. Login to that user to connect to the database, `sudo -u ohq psql`
8. You can verify your connection by running `\conninfo`

---

### NGINX
1. Install NGINX, `sudo apt install nginx`
2. Start NGINX, `sudo systemctl start nginx`
3. Edit the file at `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` to be the following

```
upstream ohq {
  server localhost:4000;
}

upstream api {
  server localhost:8000;
}

server {
  server_name <YOUR_DOMAINS>;
  listen 80;

  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
  server_name <YOUR_DOMAINS>;

  listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
  listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on;

  # RSA certificate
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR_DOMAIN>/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR_DOMAIN>/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot

  include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot

  # Redirect non-https traffic to https
  if ($scheme != "https") {
     return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
  } # managed by Certbot

  location /ohq/ {
      rewrite /ohq/(.*) /$1 break;
      proxy_pass http://ohq/;
  }

  location /api {
      rewrite /api/(.*) /$1 break;
      proxy_pass http://api;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
  }
}
```
Be sure to replace <YOUR_DOMAINS>, e.g. "cs122.andrew.cmu.edu www.cs122.andrew.cmu.edu" and replace <YOUR_DOMAIN> with the folder path we'll create in a few steps, e.g. "cs122.andrew.cmu.edu"

4. Install certbot, `sudo snap install --classic certbot` and then `sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot`
5. Use certbot to generate SSL certificates.  **THIS MAY REQUIRE DIFFERENT STEPS DEPENDING ON HOW AND WHERE YOUR DOMAIN IS HOSTED.** You will have to research this on your own.  Ideally, your certificates will be created at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR_DOMAIN>/fullchain.pem` and `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR_DOMAIN>/privkey.pem`, but if they're created in different places, you will have to modify these lines of the nginx config.  **BE AWARE THAT YOU MAY HAVE TO SETUP CERTIFICATE ROTATION**
6. You can validate your nginx config with `sudo nginx -t`
7. Start nginx with `sudo systemctl start nginx`
8. Depending on your domain hosting provider, there may be built-in ways to do this.  However, if manually configuring your website, you should be able to add a .A record to your domain and going to it should show a 502 error page from nginx!

### OAuth
1. Using the Google Cloud console, create a project and search for OAuth
2. Under "OAuth Consent Screen", select "External" as the User Type and hit "Create".
3. Follow the instructions and add your primary domain under "Authorized Domains" (e.g. for cs122.andrew.cmu.edu this domain would be cmu.edu)
4. On the next page, add the ".../auth/userinfo.email", ".../auth/userinfo.profile", and "openid" scopes
5. Publish the app to remove testing/development limitations on the number and kinds of users you can have
6. Under "Credentials", create an OAuth Client ID
7. Select "Web Application" as the type.
8. For "Authorized JavaScript origins", add the following
   - Your primary URL, e.g. "https://cs122.andrew.cmu.edu"
   - "http://localhost:3000"
   - "http://localhost:8000"
   - Your primary URL with port 443, e.g. "https://cs122.andrew.cmu.edu:443"
9. For "Authorized redirect URIs", add the following
   - Your primary URL with /login/callback, e.g. "https://cs122.andrew.cmu.edu/login/callback"
   - Your primary URL with /login/, e.g. "https://cs122.andrew.cmu.edu/login"
   - "http://localhost:3000/login/callback"
   - "http://localhost:8000/login/callback"
   - Your primary URL with a /, e.g. "https://cs122.andrew.cmu.edu/"
   - Your primary URL, e.g. "https://cs122.andrew.cmu.edu"
   - Your primary URL with port 443, e.g. "https://cs122.andrew.cmu.edu:443"

* Are all of these necessary?  Quite frankly I don't know but 122 has all of these and our queue works so just to be safe I listed them all

### q'
1. Clone this repo
2. Install Node.js 16+ for your system.  This can be done via various package managers and their site (definitely works on Node 18.19 and 16.18)
3. In both the /client and /server folders, run `npm install`
4. Setup the client and server .env files as follows:

#### Client .env
```
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=0

REACT_APP_PROTOCOL=https
REACT_APP_DOMAIN=<YOUR_DOMAIN>
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>
REACT_APP_SOCKET_PATH=/api/socket.io
REACT_APP_SERVER_PATH=/api

PUBLIC_URL=/ohq
```
#### Server .env
```
PROTOCOL=https
DOMAIN=<YOUR_DOMAIN>
CLIENT_PORT=443

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET>
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>

POSTGRESQL_DB_HOST=localhost
POSTGRESQL_DB_USER=<YOUR_POSTGRES_USER>
POSTGRESQL_DB_PASSWORD=<YOUR_POSTGRES_USER_PASSWORD>
POSTGRESQL_DB=<YOUR_POSTGRES_DB>
POSTGRESQL_DB_PORT=5432

TOKEN_KEY=<any long random string that will be used as a secret key>
OWNER_EMAIL=<YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL>
```

6. Deploy the server
```
  % cd server
  % npm run db:sync   # Only on first time running or after database modification
  % npm install -g nodemon
  % npm start
```
7. Deploy the client
```
  % cd client
  % npm run build
  % sudo npm install --global serve
  % serve -s build -l 4000 -n
```
